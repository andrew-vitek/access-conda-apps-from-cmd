# access-conda-apps-from-cmd

When I downloaded Anaconda Navigator, I initially struggled with accessing it from the command prompt (primarily because i was naive and didn't add anaconda to my PATH environment variable during setup).

Hopefully, this repository can be used to assist with properly setting up your PATH variables so you can access the Anaconda applications straight from the command prompt.

Enjoy!
